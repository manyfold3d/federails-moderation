# Federails::Moderation

A gem that provides moderation capabilities for [Federails](https://gitlab.com/experimentslabs/federails). It adds the following features:

* Handle incoming `Flag` activities, normally used for reporting content to moderators
* Block federation with particular servers

## Requirements

* [Federails](https://gitlab.com/experimentslabs/federails) >= 0.4
* Ruby >= 3.0

## Installation
Add the gem to your Rails application:

```bash
> bundle add "federails-moderation"
```

Then install the database migrations:

```bash
```

## Usage

### Reports

When your application receives a `Flag` activitypub message, it will create a `Federails::Moderation::Report` record with the details.

```ruby
# Find all unresolved reports
reports = Federails::Moderation::Report.where(resolution: nil)
r = reports.first

# Reports can have a comment that was sent with them:
puts r.content
# "This message is spam"

# It will be associated with the actor that sent it:
puts r.actor.at_address
# "@floppy@mastodon.me.uk"

# Deal with the report in your app, then either:
r.resolve!
# or, you can ignore it
r.ignore!

```

### Domain Blocks

You can block domains that are abusive like so:

```
Federails::Moderation::DomainBlock.create(domain: "spammer.com")
```

Once the block is created, incoming messages from that domain, or from any actor on that domain, will be ignored. Also, outgoing messages to that domain will be dropped before being delivered.

Actors from the blocked domain aren't currently auto-removed; this may be added in the future, but for now that's left up to your application.
